# Hangman game

Free time project, nothing serious. To run the code,

```shell
python game.py
```



## Limitation
These are the limitations that come from the by product of the code.

- cannot type same letter twice, even if it's correct.
- does not have indication of the letters we have typed.
- does not have hint. (quite hard to guess imo)
